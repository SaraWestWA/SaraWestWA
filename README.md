### Salutations👩🏻‍💻🖐🏻

Hi, I’m Sara! I am a fledgling Data Scientist studying with Lambda School.

I like numbers, logic, and order. While data science includes all of these, it also involves many unknowns and variety. After all, data is human generated; and what are humans if not sometimes incomprehensible, always varied, and yet abounding with commonalities?

My first response to "python" is no longer "snake!", pandas doesn't always mean adorable black and white bears, "random forest" isn't simply a term used to describe what one sees traveling in my native clime, and "storytelling" is now a skill describing how to share information gleaned from extensive data, as well as childhood memories of being entralled by the tales otold by visiting Uncles.
