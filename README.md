### Salutations🖐🏻

 Hi, I’m Sara! I am a fledgling Data Scientist studying with Lambda School.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... Lambda School Labs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Tesseract OCR
- 📚 My favorite Lambda sprint ... Natural Language Processing
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'd love to learn more about ... Genomic Research

I like numbers, logic, and order. While data science includes all of these, it also involves many unknowns and variety. After all, data is human generated; and what are humans if not sometimes incomprehensible, always varied, and yet abounding with commonalities? My first response to "python" is no longer "snake!"; pandas doesn't always mean adorable black and white bears; "random forest" isn't simply a term used to describe what one sees traveling in my native clime; and "storytelling" is now a skill describing how to share information gleaned from extensive data, as well as childhood memories of being entralled by the tales told by visiting relatives.
