### Salutations👩🏻‍💻🖐🏻

Hi, I’m Sara! I am a fledgling Data Scientist studying with Lambda School. I like numbers, logic, and order. While data science includes all of these, it also involves many unknowns and variety. After all, data is human generated; and what are humans if not sometimes incomprehensible, always varied, and yet so much alike?

I have spent much of 2020/21 immersed in learning how data tells stories and how to generate models to reveal those stories. My first response to "python" is no longer "snake!", pandas doesn't always mean adorable black and white bears, and "random forest" isn't simply a term used to describe what one sees traveling in my native clime.
